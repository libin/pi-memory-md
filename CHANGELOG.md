# Changelog

The npm release may lag behind the GitHub version. To get the latest updates, install from GitHub: `pi install git:github.com/VandeeFeng/pi-memory-md`

到目前为止，差不多把我计划投入给这个项目的 token 都用完了，想实现的核心功能差不多也完成了。

最开始使用 pi 不是因为 OpenClaw 的爆火，也不是因为 star 的数量，在那个时候 pi 的 star 才刚刚开始。而是我急需一个可以自己扩展的 CLI agent 来学习和构建自己的 agent。机缘巧合下，了解并安装了 pi，当时就觉得这个名字挺符合我的喜好，很容易让人感觉和联想到一种数学美感，我说实话比 codex 和 Claude Code 要好，它们的中心落在了 code 上。在终端里第一次运行，it just works（完全能满足我基础的编程学习需求）！

随后我才知道 pi 火了。

[Building Pi With Pi | Armin Ronacher's Thoughts and Writings](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2026/5/24/pi-oss/) 今天看到这篇文章。现在我还是不喜欢 AI 成分太高的来作为我需要长期使用的东西。我感觉 pi 也不可避免的要加入到这场 AI 的竞赛当中。

我还是打算把 70% 的 token 用来学习知识和拓展能力，30% 用来写代码和补全（付费和本地的都算）。

我正在着手尝试构建自己的 pi - phi (φ 黄金比例)，回到第一次接触到 pi 的时候就本来要完成的事情，也是对这段时间学习的检验。我不喜欢 TypeScript（虽然 ts 对于构建 agent 来说很友好也挺必须），而且更喜欢 Claude Code 对 shell 部分的交互与处理。

因此后续这个项目的更新会非常缓慢了。这个项目的所有生成的代码都是在 pi 的协助下完成，感谢 pi！在看 pi 的源码和架构的时候，学到了许多。

希望下一个 commit 是在 phi 里完成。

See you!

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- [#9](https://github.com/VandeeFeng/pi-memory-md/issues/9): Windows: "not a git repo" error due to path separator mismatch (forward vs backslash)
- [#10](https://github.com/VandeeFeng/pi-memory-md/issues/10): `isMemoryInitialized()` only checks for core folder existence

## [0.1.38] - 2026-05-25

### Changed

The previous thread design created too many anchors, and many of them were unnecessary.

The current design treats anchors as meaningful checkpoints, not as a log for every thread operation. Creating a thread, creating a branch route, checking out a node, or updating the current head is tracked in the thread state file only. Tape anchors are now reserved for root/node checkpoints that contain resumable context such as summaries, decisions, next tasks, files, and memory links. Thread anchors also no longer write hard-coded `purpose` values like `root-node` or `node`, because those labels add no useful intent signal for the agent.

- Refined TapeThread creation flow by separating lightweight thread/branch routing from anchor-backed root/node checkpoints. This avoids creating tape anchors for structural routing changes while keeping anchors reserved for meaningful resumable context.
- Updated TapeThread branch records to support multiple node targets from the same branch point, so a branch route can accumulate related checkpoints over time.
- Hid TapeThread anchors from the `/memory-review` timeline view while keeping them available in the dedicated thread view.

## [0.1.37] - 2026-05-25

<summary>Release notes</summary>

https://xavier.xfaang.com/blog/do-agents-dream.html It is written from an agent's point of view, comparing every new conversation to a kind of amnesia. I found that pretty interesting.

With my still-limited understanding of context engineering, even though model providers keep claiming larger and larger maximum context windows, my actual experience is that the truly effective context window has not grown that much. Compute capacity and the model's attention mechanism are probably still the main constraints on output quality.

I do not know if this is just my illusion, but I also feel that the current model cache mechanism makes the context less effective and accurate.

I have not studied the theory of model context deeply. At this stage, I would rather spend more effort on my own memory records by hands. The quality of the input is always the core thing, and I think that work pays off long-term.

Every conversation is new to an agent. Giving the agent an accurate index and a specific guide letting it look things up when needed already feels good enough to me right now.

As always, I don't want to rely too much on the agent. When I am not using it, I can still manually grep these well-organized memory files for keywords、tags、anchors and find the relevant parts myself. Instead of giving an agent a vague prompt and asking it to search through a huge pile of data, I still prefer to first locate things from my own memory, then pass them to the agent. I need to maintain my own mental-model。

In this project, I keep reminding myself to strengthen both sides of the memory design at the same time: for the agent, and also first for human.

As we already know, agent memory has two layers: short-term and long-term. The context window is like RAM: fast, temporary, and limited. Memory files are like disk storage: slower to query, but persistent and easier to organize. I prefer using an index as the entry point into these memory files, then locating the relevant details only when needed. For now, I roughly treat that index as the agent's short-term memory.

I don't have a strong preference between storing memories as files or in a database. I lean toward files mostly because I already take a lot of notes in my daily life, and files feel simpler and more natural to me.

This project should continue to focus on long-term memory. The added `memory-digest` skill is exactly for this. LLM is good at finding connections across large amounts of data, which fits naturally with maintaining long-term memory.

The `sessionBridge` hook is a tiny handoff for closely related session switches. On `new`, `resume`, or `fork`, when the previous session's last entry is within the bridge window (60 seconds by default), a small BM25 index is built from its user/assistant messages, and the prepared index is held until the next `before_agent_start`. At that point the current prompt queries the index, and only matches above the score threshold are rendered into a compact `<session_bridge>` block.

When tape-mode is on, `sessionBridge` also scans handoff anchors and builds a separate BM25 index from each anchor's name, summary, and purpose. Those anchor matches are rendered as an extra `<tape_anchors>` section. Without tape, the message bridge still works.

[Getting the most out of Codex](https://x.com/jxnlco/status/2057153744630890620) Codex’s Durable-Thread is pretty similar to the anchor extension I’ve been working on recently: each anchor is a node, and linking them together forms a thread. The word “thread” just felt too right here, so yeah, I borrowed it!

`tape-thread` is basically a lightweight thread board on top of tape anchors. Create with `/memory-thread` and your prompt: thread creation makes a `thread/{threadName}` anchor, root work items become `thread/{threadName}-{HHMMSS}-[root-node]` anchors, and branch steps become `thread/{threadName}-{branchName}-{HHMMSS}-[node]` anchors. The thread JSONL then links those anchors with parent/children relationships and keeps a HEAD pointer, so you can review the work tree, checkout an earlier node, branch from it, and keep extending the task, just like git. Its main use is simple: split a long task into resumable stages. Where the work stopped, what decisions were made, what comes next, and which files matter all live on the current node, so a later resume can continue from compact context instead of rereading the whole chat. On disk, it writes a JSONL file named `{projectName}__threads.jsonl` under the tape path, next to the existing anchor index. More details: [Tape thread design](docs/tape-thread-design.md)

In this release, long-term memory management is strengthened across several areas. And those improvements feed back into the development of this project itself.

</details>

### Breaking Changes

- Migrated pi package imports and runtime dependencies to the new `@earendil-works/*` npm scope introduced in [pi v0.74.0](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/releases/tag/v0.74.0). This GitHub version now requires pi packages from `@earendil-works` (`>=0.74.0`).

### New Features

- Added Thread Review UI to `/memory-review` for browsing tape thread nodes, opening node anchors, checking out nodes, and archiving threads from the visual overlay.
- Added TapeThread, a tape-backed intent thread layer with dedicated `thread` anchors for managing long-running work with root nodes, named branches, checkout, compact resume context, and optional `tape.thread: false` disablement. See [TapeThread Design](docs/tape-thread-design.md).
  Inspired by: [Getting the most out of Codex](https://x.com/jxnlco/status/2057153744630890620)
- Added `hooks.beforeAgentStart: ["sessionBridge"]`, an opt-in bridge for closely related `new`/`resume`/`fork` sessions. It indexes recent previous session messages, plus handoff anchors when tape is active, and sends only prompt-relevant matches to the next agent turn. In `message-append` delivery it joins the startup memory message; in `system-prompt` delivery it is sent as a hidden bridge message.
- Added BM25-based ranking for memory retrieval via `@orama/orama`, with Chinese tokenization via `nodejieba`. `memory_search(query)` now uses BM25 ranking by default to prioritize relevant memory files by title/tags/description/content, and tape smart-mode delivery uses the first prompt plus recent anchor summary/purpose/keywords to rank candidate files. Chinese and mixed-language query/index text is segmented before ranking, improving fuzzy-topic recall and reducing noisy top results from pure keyword/recency ordering.
- Added `memory-digest` skill for turning recent tape anchors and relevant session context into confirmed durable memory updates via `memory-write`.

### Changed

- Added `/memory-check` scope options (`-g`/`--global`/`global` and `-p`/`--project`/`project`) while keeping tree line-count arguments order-independent.
- Classified pi's native `session_start` reasons into `runtimeStart` (`startup`/`reload`) and `switchStart` (`new`/`resume`/`fork`) so the `sessionStart` hook type maps to our runtime-start lifecycle, while switch starts remain available for `previousSessionFile`-based bridge context.
- Updated `tape_read` formatted output controls: defaults to 300 content characters per entry, accepts `maxContentChars` for custom truncation, and uses `maxContentChars: null` for full content.
- Improved tape edit focus extraction by counting only changed diff lines instead of surrounding context lines. Pi's native edit result returns a numbered diff that includes both changed lines and nearby context lines; tape now ignores those context lines, parses only `+` lines as the primary edit focus, falls back to `-` lines for deletion-only edits, and uses `firstChangedLine` only when no changed line can be extracted.
- Deprecated and disabled the `memory_list` tool; use `memory_check({ directory })` for directory-scoped memory inspection.
- Refined tape smart analysis scoring with smooth time decay, BM25-inspired repeated-access saturation, anchor decay boosts, and a clearer multi-signal event score model for selecting active memory and project files.
- Removed the registered `tape_list` tool. Use `tape_search({ kinds: ["anchor"], contextLines })` for the same recent-anchor browsing workflow, now with anchor ids, filters, range options, and optional nearby context in one tool.

### Fixed

- Skipped empty tape delivery when no memory/project files are selected; tape context builders now return `null` for no content and omit empty sections, avoiding blank custom messages or system-prompt additions. Initial context cache state now explicitly distinguishes `pending`, `empty`, and `ready`, preventing an empty first selection from being re-initialized and delivered unexpectedly later in the same session.
- `tape_search` now falls back from session-scope entry and anchor search to project-scope search when the session has no matching results.
- Improved `tape_search` anchor context output: `contextLines` now skips empty handoff helper messages and anchor JSON tool results, showing the surrounding user/assistant text instead.

## [0.1.36] - 2026-05-06

<details>
<summary>Release notes</summary>

Pi is moving so fast now. I missed the releases for just one week, and there were already so many new features.

I don't know whether this is a good thing or a bad thing for Pi.

`memory_write` tool is also a bad design. In the beginning, it was just like `memory_read` — both started as skill + script. Now I'm back to that original simple pattern.

As pi versions move forward, the custom TUI rendering can run into a few small bugs, and frankly, that's not where I want to spend my energy. The behavior implemented by `memory_write` does not really need to be a tool; apart from looking a little nicer, the custom TUI rendering does not add much practical value.

With these skills, users can customize their own slash commands based on their needs.

I also removed `memory-sync` and `memory-search` skills, their behavior is fully covered by the native `memory_sync` and `memory_search` tool.As LLM capabilities improve, tool descriptions and the other metadata around tools are already clear enough to guide the model's decisions, so these skills shouldn't occupy valuable context window space.

Beyond `/tree` as an anchor selector, now we have `/memory-review` to quickly search your own intent and jump back to the relevant conversation.

We are basically Doctor Strange now: hopping across timelines and opening parallel universes, but with fewer capes and more anchors.

I originally wanted to build this on top of Pi's native `/tree` UI instead of creating another surface. But the workflows I wanted here don't fit cleanly into `/tree` without changing its core, so `/memory-review` became a dedicated visual panel for anchors.

The panel only helps you land on the right anchor, after jumping there, any deeper branching or tree operations still belong in Pi's native `/tree` panel. I kept this intentionally non-invasive.

It is an overlay UI for quickly viewing all anchors in the current project and provides a simple visualization. Selecting an anchor can quickly return to that conversation. All functionality is implemented with pi's native APIs.

And also, search is available starting with `/`, just like searching in `/tree`.

I design this visual anchor panel because I want to do such job on my own. Input a prompt, agent will handle all these with `tape_search` tool, but I prefer doing this by hand. At least, not everytime by prompt.

Easier is not the same as simple. AI can lower the friction, but it can't turn inherently complex thing into simple.

I solemnly swear: I am never poking Pi's TUI design again.

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlGRN8jh2RI][Anthropic's Boris Cherny: Why Coding Is Solved, and What Comes Next - YouTube]], I watched this Boris Cherny interview, and I really buy his printing press analogy. Code generation is getting easier and cheaper—that's definitely a thing for society. It's now possible for non-coders to ship code with LLM (myself included). But with token costs stacking up, LLM-assisted coding isn't exactly "code equality." The wealth gap still cuts in.

Digital storage with keyboard input is about efficiency, handwriting addresses hobby and joy. They're not conflicting — it's just that people have different preferences and values, that's all.

I still don't like letting agents handle everything. For this project, about 80% is LLM-generated. The remaining 20% is where I lay out the architecture and logic, and the agent fills in the blanks.(That's honestly the most I can do right now).

I can't stand the function names LLM come up with!

Like Paul Graham says in "Hackers & Painters", coding is just like writing. What I love is the pleasure of thinking through problems and expressing myself—not delegating to an agent to spit out some factory-standard result.

What I dislike most is that the agent takes my thought process and logical flow and reduces them to cold, auto-generated code.

The trend toward industrialization and standardization is unavoidable, but as always, the art will persist.

我无法保证这些代码的质量和品味，但至少 changelog 我可以完全手写 （英文部分机翻）。

</details>

### New Features

- **`/memory-review` slash command**: Opens an interactive Memory Review overlay for browsing tape anchors by timeline, keyword relations, and stats, with keyboard navigation and dynamic terminal-aware layout. Pressing `enter` on a selected anchor now jumps through pi's session tree to the first assistant entry after that anchor. This slash command is only registered when tape mode is enabled.
  Search is available with `/`: type to fuzzy-filter anchors across names, summaries, purposes, triggers, keywords, and timestamps. Press `Esc` or `Ctrl+C` to leave search input.
  Select an anchor and press `Ctrl+d` to delete it.

- **`memory-import` skill**: New skill for importing durable knowledge from URLs, folders, or files into pi-memory-md. Uses `npx defuddle` for web content extraction, analyzes sources before writing, asks for focus confirmation, and generates memories directly via `memory-write` skill with proper description, tags, and source references.

### Changed
- Removed the `memory-sync` and `memory-search` skills. Sync and search are now covered by the native `memory_sync` and `memory_search` tools, avoiding duplicate skill/tool designs.
- Refined memory metadata around a unified `MemoryMeta` model shared by tools and commands, covering project metadata, project memory, global memory, initialization state, and file counts.
- Simplified `memory_check` tool output for LLM use: it now returns concise project/global memory paths and file lists without tree output, while keeping lightweight renderer details only for UI summaries.
- Removed `/memory-status` and merged its repository status output into `/memory-check`. `/memory-check` now shows status first, keeps dirty repo warnings separate from the tree output, and accepts an optional max-line argument such as `/memory-check 30` (default: 25) to avoid dumping too much tree output into the terminal.
- Refined delivered context formatting to compact XML-like sections with `mode="normal" | "tape"`, unified memory file entries, and clearer global/project source markers, making context easier for LLMs to parse.
- **`memory-write` skill**: Replaced the removed `memory_write` tool. Now uses bundled `scripts/memory-write.sh` to resolve memory directory, create files with validated frontmatter (`description`, `tags`, `created`, `updated`), and refresh `updated` timestamps on edits. Preserves YAML frontmatter when updating existing memories.
- `tape_handoff` is now blocked in `manual` anchor mode before execution unless a keyword match or manual handoff match is present — preventing unauthorized direct calls while preserving keyword-triggered and explicit manual handoffs.
- Tape session lookup now respects `PI_CODING_AGENT_SESSION_DIR` before falling back to `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR/sessions`, because pi `0.71.0` added `PI_CODING_AGENT_SESSION_DIR` for configuring session storage from the environment. See [docs/usage.md#environment-variables](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/blob/v0.71.0/docs/usage.md#environment-variables).
- Tape runtime now detaches captured `sessionManager` references on session shutdown or runtime replacement via `TapeService.detachSessionTree()`, and clears the active tape runtime during shutdown to avoid reusing stale session-bound objects. See [v0.69.0](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/releases/tag/v0.69.0)
- Updated TypeBox imports from `@sinclair/typebox` to `typebox` to match pi `0.69.0+`, where pi switched to the new TypeBox package name.

### Fixed

- Clarified `session_start` handling for `/new` and `/fork` sessions with `previousSessionFile`: memory context is delivered without rerunning session-start hooks, avoiding duplicate hook execution while preserving handoff context. This follows pi's documented lifecycle where `/new` emits `session_start { reason: "new", previousSessionFile? }` and `/fork` emits `session_start { reason: "fork", previousSessionFile }`. See [pi extension lifecycle](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/blob/v0.72.0/packages/coding-agent/docs/extensions.md#lifecycle-overview) and [session_start](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/blob/v0.72.0/packages/coding-agent/docs/extensions.md#session_start).
- Optimized git sync checks with a 12-hour `FETCH_HEAD` freshness window: recent fetch/pull evidence skips another `git fetch`, stale or missing evidence refreshes upstream first, behind detection still uses `git rev-list --count HEAD..@{u}`, and updates now run `git rebase --autostash @{u}` to avoid the extra fetch performed by `git pull --rebase --autostash`. A post-update behind check still warns users to resolve git issues manually if commits remain behind upstream.
  This avoids repeated network checks on every new session while still refreshing upstream periodically.

## [0.1.35] - 2026-04-30

<details>
<summary>Release notes</summary>

For global and shared knowledge, I still personally prefer AGENTS.md + manual management. So I won't add global memory writes to `memory_write`; the native `write` tool + AGENTS.md is already convenient enough.

pi-memory-md should first ensure strong memory management and optimization for the project level — that's the design principle and tradeoff behind this choice.

I still believe that things requiring hand-writing should not be delegated to AI or automation, and the global things do not change very frequently ether.

At the outset, I didn’t want `pi-memory-md` to become overly complex. It should be a compatible memory assistant tool, and lately I’ve been continuously experimenting with and refining that compatibility.

Those new Markdown files are not mandatory, they can work well alongside the user’s custom AGENTS.md.

</details>

### Changes

- Updated memory layout naming and initialization paths: shared global files now live directly under `{globalMemory}/` as `USER.md`, `MEMORY.md`, and `TASK.md`, while project task memory now uses `core/TASK.md` instead of `core/task/task.md`.
  `MEMORY.md` is only offered for `globalMemory`, and preference content is consolidated into `USER.md` instead of separate `prefer.md` files.
  This keeps the structure closer to agent conventions like Hermes/OpenClaw and only affects newly initialized files and context selection behavior, not existing memory files.

- Clarified native tool path semantics: `memory_write` uses project-memory-relative paths; `memory_list` returns project memory as relative paths and global memory as absolute paths.
  I think global memory should be maintained more manually with user's guide, while project memory is a better fit for pi-memory-md's native tools.
  Project memory in pi-memory-md is first meant for AI, and of course also for human. So `memory_write` supports project-level memory files. For `globalMemory`, I personally think it needs more deliberate manual maintenance, so `memory_write` does not support writing to or modifying global memory.

- Refined delivered memory context formatting: it now uses a unified `# Memory Context` header, clearer global/project sections, absolute memory file paths, and a short note that memory files help the agent better understand the project and the user.
- Commented out legacy built-in memory initialization helpers and removed their tests, since initialization now lives in the `memory-init` skill.

### Fixed

- Fixed `memory_check` and global memory enablement detection: shared global memory is now treated as enabled only when `memoryDir.globalMemory` is explicitly configured.
  When project memory exists but shared global memory is missing, `memory_check` no longer reports `Not initialized`; it continues to show the project memory structure and only warns about the missing shared global directory when global memory was actually enabled by config.

## [0.1.34]

<details>
<summary>Release notes</summary>

God damn, the LLM makes so many logic errors! Even the bash script!

If it isn’t stated very explicitly in the prompt, the LLM’s logic gets confused easily once the context grows a little longer. I’ve noticed that recent LLMs seem noticeably dumber lately—maybe I’m just not paying enough.

This is an emergency patch release that had to be shipped.

</details>

### Changes

- **`memory-init` no longer forces `reference/` directory creation**: initialization now only ensures `core/project` and `core/task`, while `prefer.md` lives directly under `core/`, removing the fixed `reference/` folder requirement.
  The `identity` folder was originally kept as a reference to Letta's design, but through daily use I found it provided very little value, either to the agent or to myself, so I decided to remove it.

  To be precise: the script now only creates `core/project/` and `core/task/` for the project, plus `{globalMemory}/core/task/` when global memory is enabled. Files such as `core/prefer.md`, `core/task/task.md`, `{globalMemory}/core/prefer.md`, and `{globalMemory}/core/task/task.md` are optional and created only if the user chooses the corresponding templates or imports preferences.

## [0.1.33] - 2026-04-28

<details>
<summary>Release notes</summary>

I'm really happy to have such helpful contributions — everyone's support has helped uncover and fix many issues I couldn't have found on my own.

And I've learned a lot!

Special thanks to:
- [@nqh-packages](https://github.com/nqh-packages)'s PR [#7](https://github.com/VandeeFeng/pi-memory-md/pull/7) for the globalMemory feature contribution!
- [@musaddiq-dev](https://github.com/musaddiq-dev)'s PR [#8](https://github.com/VandeeFeng/pi-memory-md/pull/8) for husky config to avoid `pi update` failure.

I think the `memory-init` tool is a bad design, so it's gone to jail now!

The built-in `memory-init` tool had too many constraints, so I abstracted and consolidated this tool into SKILL.

This skill provides guides through creating the memory folder structure and asks whether to create specific subfolders, giving users more autonomy.

This also better complements the design of globalMemory.

The experience of this part is the same as before, even smoother.

</details>

### Features

- **globalMemory: shared memory directory across projects**: Configures a shared memory folder (default: `global/`) under `localPath` accessible from any project.
  When enabled, global files such as `global/core/prefer.md` and `global/core/task/` are included in memory context alongside project-specific memory.
  Configure as a string value in `memoryDir.globalMemory` (e.g., `"globalMemory": "global"`).
  When configured, global memory files are also included in the delivered memory hidden message.

### Changes

- **Unified `memoryDir` config block**: `repoUrl`, `localPath`, and `globalMemory` are now consolidated under `memoryDir` for cleaner configuration. Top-level fields remain supported for backward compatibility.
  ```md
  "memoryDir": {
    "repoUrl": "git@github.com:username/repo.git", // Or HTTPS format
    "localPath": "~/.pi/memory-md",
    "globalMemory": "global"
  }
  ```
  Previously these were separate top-level fields. They still work, but `memoryDir` is the preferred structure.

- **Replaced `/memory-init` command and built-in tool with `memory-init` skill**: Provides greater flexibility and user-driven configuration instead of hardcoded logic.
  The skill delegates to `scripts/memory-init.sh` and prompts users to select templates and import preferences from AGENTS.md.
  The built-in `memory-init` tool had too many constraints. I abstracted and consolidated this tool into SKILL, preserving its original functionality while adding more flexibility and user control

- **Renamed `kind` to `type` for TapeAnchor**: `TapeAnchor.kind` → `TapeAnchor.type`, `TapeAnchorKind` → `TapeAnchorType`, `anchorKind` → `anchorType`.
  Before: `{"id":"...","kind":"handoff",...}` → After: `{"id":"...","type":"handoff",...}`
  `type` is more semantically accurate.
  **Note**: This will affect stored JSONL anchor records.

- **Unified AnchorStore query API**: Added `query(options: QueryOptions)` method that unifies id/name/sessionId/sessionEntryId filtering with `returnMode` ('first', 'last', 'all').
  Removed old `findById`, `findByName`, `findByNameInSession`, `findAllByName`, `findBySession`, `findBySessionEntryId`, `getLastAnchor` methods. Use `query()` instead.
  `search()` remains unchanged for complex queries (text search, time ranges, meta filtering).

### Fixed

- **Support `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` environment variable**: All modules now respect this env var for global settings path, defaulting to `~/.pi/agent` if unset.

## [0.1.32] - 2026-04-27

<details>
<summary>Release notes</summary>

I think the `memory_read` tool is a bad idea — it doesn't add any real value and only imposes unnecessary constraints on reading and managing memory files, also hindered feature expansion.

It's gone to jail!

I've been working on compatibility issues for worktrees lately.

Less is more — I need to keep streamlining the code.

Big thanks to everyone who flagged issues in the PRs — really appreciate the feedback!

This project is meant to provide the basic memory foundation and scaffolding, so it's ready to integrate with more sophisticated memory systems down the road. That's about as far as I can take it with my current abilities.

For modern agents, context handling is where the big gains are. Got plenty of ideas rattling around in my head, and I need to dig deeper into the theory.

For now, this project needs to focus on the fundamentals — solid framework design, stability, and extensibility.

**Strange thing**: whenever I publish an npm release, a new big issue always shows up.

</details>

### Features

- **Worktree memory integration**: Memory tools now automatically resolve to the main repository's memory directory when operating in a worktree, using the `mainRoot` project name for path resolution.
  Project core memory files don't vary much across worktrees, so I think sharing them makes sense for better continuity.

### Changes

- **Worktree smart mode refinement**: Tape smart mode no longer falls back to scanning all memory files when there's no access history. Since worktrees have independent tape sessions (pi stores session JSONL history per worktree), they won't have memory file access history — returning an empty result is more appropriate than a full directory scan.This ensures file weights are calculated correctly for the current worktree's context.
- **Removed `memory_read` tool**: The memory read tool has been removed from the tool registry. Reading memory files is now handled by the native `read` tool with context hints. Tape-mode context now displays "Recent memory files" instead of "Available memory files" to clarify the smart selection behavior.

  I think this tool is somewhat redundant — beyond a bit of UI convenience, there's no fundamental difference from the native `read` tool.
  This also eliminates the need for complex path validation logic and removes the ambiguity around whether memory files outside the `core/` folder should be included or excluded.
  The memory delivery content already ensures that files in the `core/` folder are clearly communicated to the agent.
  And I think such guide for the agent shouldn't be overly restrictive on tool usage.

- **Removed session-start initialization notification**: No more "Memory-md not initialized. Use /memory-init to set up" notification on session start.
  That notify was really annoying.

### Fixed

- **Tape reader LRU caching**: Added `LRUCache` class to replace the unbounded `Map` caches in `tape-reader.ts`, preventing memory bloat during long sessions. `getSessionFilePath` now also validates session header cache via mtime/size before returning cached results.
- **AnchorStore findById simplification**: `findById` now uses `allAnchors` instead of iterating nested index maps, reducing lookup complexity from O(n*m) to O(n).
- **Tape context warmup fix**: `initDeliveryContent` (formerly `initMemoryContext`) now returns `true` when tape is enabled (even without memory directory), preventing the repeated `cacheInitialContext` calls that used to happen on every `before_agent_start` when memory files don't exist.

## [0.1.31] - 2026-04-25

<details>
<summary>Release notes</summary>

I can't wrap my head around why LLM came up the code checking for a `.git` directory by walking up the folder tree to decide if it's a git repo — that's so dumb!

In this release, all memory context and tape-mode file selections are now pre-built asynchronously at `session_start` and cached for reuse at every `before_agent_start`, significantly cutting latency and eliminating the stuttering you used to feel on each turn.

Security boundaries have also been hardened: symlink traversals inside the memory directory are now blocked to prevent escape, search execution is bounded with timeouts and pattern limits to prevent runaway abuse, and project-level settings can no longer override high-trust global memory settings such as `repoUrl` or `localPath`.

In my daily use, I sometimes run pi outside of a git repo. So I added `onlyGit` and `excludeDirs` to avoid triggering tape's file analysis all the time.

There’s still some logic problems I need to tidy up.

### Features

- **Recent focus hints**: Tape context can now attach concise `recent focus` line ranges to selected memory files and recently active project files, based on recent `read` offsets and parsed `edit` diffs from session history within the effective smart-scan window. The delivered summary keeps the latest merged ranges (up to five per file), for example `read 340-420` or `edit 390-399`, so the agent can see which parts of each file were actually touched most recently.
- **Tape activation rules**: Tape now uses `"onlyGit": true` by default, so tape runs only inside a Git repository. Git detection now uses `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` instead of manually checking for a `.git` directory, so worktrees and subdirectories resolve correctly. You can also add absolute `"excludeDirs"` paths, and built-in system/temp directories are excluded by default for safety.

### Changes

- **Session-start caching mechanism**: Moved heavy initialization work from `before_agent_start` to `session_start`: tape activation resolution (`git rev-parse --show-toplevel`, exclude dir matching), `TapeService` and `MemoryFileSelector` instantiation (including anchor index loading), memory directory state checks, session-start hooks execution (git pull), and async context pre-building (memory dir scanning, file reading, smart file selection). The cached `initialMemoryContext` and `initialTapeContext` are then reused across all subsequent `before_agent_start` calls, significantly reducing agent response latency at the start of each turn.
- **Async API refactoring**: Core file operations (`memory_read`, `memory_write`, `memory_list`, `memory_sync`) and session management functions now return `Promise` results. Internal modules (`index.ts`, `memory-core.ts`, `utils.ts`) were updated to properly await these async operations, with parallel promises wrapped via `Promise.all()` where applicable.
- **Delivery wording replaces injection wording**: In settings, `["injection": "..."]` is replaced by `["delivery": "..."]`. Both config fields still work.
  `injection` easily suggests bad things like `prompt injection` specially in LLM area, and pi-memory-md does not actually inject memory anyway; it delivers memory by appending a hidden message or appending to the system prompt, so I think `deliver` / `delivery` is a more accurate description.
- **Tape config is now opt-out**: If a `"tape"` block exists, tape is enabled by default. Only `"enabled": false` disables it, while existing `"enabled": true` configs continue to work unchanged.
- **Tape context include/exclude overhaul**: In tape config, `"alwaysInclude": [...]` is replaced by `"whitelist": [...]`, and you can now also add `"blacklist": [...]`. Smart project-file delivery prefers `rg --files` ignore behavior when available, falls back to a built-in default ignore list for common noise, keeps `"blacklist"` as a hard exclude, and treats `"whitelist"` as a force-include override.
- **Deprecated legacy tape include setting**: If your config still uses `"alwaysInclude": [...]`, it will keep working for now, but please move it to `"whitelist": [...]`.

### Fixed

- **Unified project root resolution**: Added a shared `ProjectMeta` model to centralize project path handling. Project root detection now uses `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`, and all project directory logic consistently uses the resolved Git root when available, or falls back to `cwd` otherwise.
- **Tape handoff match flow**: `tape_handoff` now resolves keyword and manual handoffs internally instead of exposing `trigger` or `keywords` to the model. The model only provides `name`, `summary`, and `purpose`, and keyword handoffs only apply when the created anchor name matches the hidden keyword instruction for the current turn.
- **Smart project file tracking**: Smart tape selection now keeps `read` / `edit` / `write` project file paths as full project paths, so active non-memory files are ranked and delivered correctly.
- **Project settings trust boundary**: Project-level `.pi/settings.json` no longer overrides high-trust memory settings like `repoUrl`, `localPath`, sync hooks, legacy `autoSync`, or `tape.tapePath`. Those values now remain controlled by global user settings.
- **Symlink escape protection**: `memory_read`, `memory_write`, and `memory_list` now reject memory paths that traverse symbolic links inside the memory directory, preventing reads and writes from escaping the memory root through symlinked entries.
- **Bounded memory search execution**: `memory_search` now applies a timeout to `grep` / `rg`, caps custom pattern length, and limits search matches per command to reduce runaway regex and heavy search abuse.

<summary>Release notes</summary>

I'am sorry for so many default settings changes like the tapePath in tape-mode these days. But all these default settings remain customizable.

The reason is I’m thinking hard about the base logic in pi-memory-md, both the code side and the design side.

More stable chassis, longer mileage.

There’s still a lot of logic problems in the code I need to tidy up before next step.

After more than half a month of daily use and iteration, tape-mode is much more stable now.

The npm release may lag behind the GitHub version. To get the latest updates, install from GitHub: `pi install git:github.com/VandeeFeng/pi-memory-md`

</details>

### Features

- **Tape `/tree` compatibility**: Mirror tape anchors into pi `/tree` labels so anchored nodes are visible directly in the tree navigator. Customize the `/tree` anchor label prefix in setting with `"labelPrefix": "⚓ "`.
- **Anchor deletion tool**: Added `tape_delete` so tape anchors can be removed by id, with `/tree` mirrored labels resynced after deletion.
- **Anchor context listing**: `tape_list` now supports `contextLines` and returns anchor kind, metadata, and nearby entry context.
- **Manual handoff weighting**: Smart tape selection now boosts memory accesses after recent handoff anchors instead of treating generic anchors as the recency boundary.
- **Project file activity weighting**: Smart tape selection now also tracks `read` / `edit` / `write` tool usage, resolves those paths to full project file paths, and ranks them above `memory_read` / `memory_write`, with handoff-era activity weighted highest.
- **Keyword-triggered handoff prompts**: Tape can now match configured keywords from user prompts and deliver a hidden instruction telling the model to create a `tape_handoff` anchor before continuing the task.
- **Manual handoff mode**: Added `settings.tape.anchor.mode` so direct proactive `tape_handoff` calls can be hard-blocked, while dedicated `trigger: "keyword"` and `trigger: "manual"` flows remain allowed.
- **User-created manual anchors**: Added `/memory-anchor` so users can send a prompt to the LLM and have it derive a handoff anchor with `meta.trigger = "manual"` through the dedicated manual-anchor flow.

### Changes

- **Configurable anchor path**: Now `settings.tape.tapePath` customize where anchor index files are stored. Defaults to `{localPath}/TAPE`. The dumb `anchor-index` folder was removed.
- **Anchor model cleanup**: Anchors now use `kind` plus optional `meta` instead of the old loose `state` shape.
- **Tape runtime consolidation**: Collapsed separate tape service / selector / runtime key fields into a single `activeTapeRuntime` object.
- **Session lifecycle anchors**: Tape now uses `session/new` for new-session entry points and `session/resume` for continued-session entry points instead of flattening everything into `session/start`.
- **Anchor config simplification**: Removed threshold-based auto-anchor settings; `settings.tape.anchor` now only controls display options such as `labelPrefix` and `keywords`.
- **Tape docs relocation**: The old `skills/tape-mode/SKILL.md` guide was moved into `docs/tape-design.md`, and the package no longer registers tape mode as a skill.
- **Git sync noise reduction**: Session-start pull and session-end push now skip redundant syncs, and successful no-op syncs no longer notify the user.

  This was really annoying!
- **Tape memory summary reuse**: Tape smart-mode delivery now normalizes selected paths under the memory directory and reuses the traditional memory summary output (`Description`/`Tags`) for them, even when selected via absolute paths.

### Fixed

- **Smart selector ranking refinement**: Smart tape selection now applies diminishing returns to repeated accesses, gives stronger weight to `edit` / `write` activity than plain `read`, adds a recency bonus to recently touched files, ignores stale paths whose files no longer exist, and limits handoff boosts to the first 15 entries after the latest matching anchor with time decay.
- **Runtime state simplification**: Removed the unused repo initialization ref and reshaped `index.ts` state around the current extension behavior: tape tool registration, session-start hook coordination, initial memory delivery, and active tape runtime.
- **Tape + system-prompt alignment**: Tape mode now follows the same append semantics as normal `system-prompt` mode by appending to `event.systemPrompt` instead of replacing it.
- **Tree label resync cleanup**: Tape `/tree` label syncing now clears all anchor-prefixed labels in the current session tree before rebuilding, preventing stale anchor labels from appearing on multiple entries.
- **Smart selector time-window logic**: Smart tape selection no longer uses the latest arbitrary anchor as a hard cutoff. It now scans recent memory access history using `context.memoryScan` with a preferred and fallback window.
- **Recent-only semantics restored**: `recent-only` now matches its original intent by sorting memory files by modification time and selecting the newest files first.
- **Duplicate tape memory delivery**: Tape delivery now de-duplicates `alwaysInclude` and selector results before building the delivered memory index.
- **Keyword handoff authorization**: `tape_handoff` now only accepts `trigger: "keyword"` when the current turn actually produced a real keyword match. Unauthorized keyword-trigger metadata is downgraded to a normal direct handoff anchor, and the stored `keywords` come from the verified match instead of model-supplied arguments.
- **Tape keyword normalization**: Tape keyword settings are normalized on load so matching stays case-insensitive and de-duplicated.

## [0.1.29] - 2026-04-21

### Warning

- Old `autoSync.onSessionStart` is still supported and normalized into the new hooks config, but migration to `hooks` is recommended.

### Features

- **Hooks-based session actions**: Replaced the old `autoSync` model with `hooks.sessionStart` and `hooks.sessionEnd`, allowing multiple actions per trigger and future custom hook actions.

### Fixed

- **Settings reload semantics**: Aligned `pi-memory-md` settings behavior with native pi runtime semantics. Settings are now loaded on extension initialization and applied on runtime reload.

### Improvements

- **Partial memory reads**: Added `offset` and `limit` support to `memory_read` for more targeted file reads

## [0.1.27] - 2026-04-17

### Features

- **Tape query scoping**: Added `scope` (`session`/`project`) and `anchorScope` (`current-session`/`project`) to `tape_search` and `tape_read`
- **Cross-session tape reads**: `TapeService` can now load entries from all sessions of the current project when using `scope: "project"`
- **Session-aware anchor resolution**: Anchor lookup now prefers current-session matches when requested, then falls back to project scope

### Fixed

- **Path traversal hardening**: Added safe path resolution for `memory_read`, `memory_write`, and `memory_list`
- **Memory status init check**: `memory_sync(status)` now validates both `core/user` and `.git` on disk instead of relying on runtime flag state
- **Frontmatter consistency**: `memory_write` now preserves original `created` date when updating files
- **Init workflow robustness**: `memory_init` now checks project memory dir state and ensures default structure/files after successful sync

### Improvements

- **Smart selector scope upgrade**: `MemoryFileSelector` smart mode now evaluates tape entries in project scope (cross-session) and uses the latest project anchor timestamp as the recency boundary
- **Settings hot reload**: Runtime re-reads `settings.json`, and `localPath` updates immediately (with `~` expansion)
- **Auto-anchor lifecycle**: Moved threshold auto-anchor handling to a single `tool_result` listener and reset tape selectors when tape mode is disabled
- **Selector token budgeting**: Conversation selection now trims from newest entries and restores chronological output order
